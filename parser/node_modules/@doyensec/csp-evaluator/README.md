# CSP Evaluator Core NPM Library

## Introduction

Please note: this is a porting of the [original CSP evaluator library](https://github.com/google/csp-evaluator).

This is not an official Google product.

CSP Evaluator allows developers and security experts to check if a Content
Security Policy ([CSP](https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/index.html)) serves as a
strong mitigation against [cross-site scripting
attacks](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/learning/xss/). It assists
with the process of reviewing CSP policies, and helps identify subtle CSP
bypasses which undermine the value of a policy. CSP Evaluator checks are based
on a [large-scale study](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45542.html) and are
aimed to help developers to harden their CSP and improve the security of their
applications. This tool (also available as a [Chrome
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csp-evaluator/fjohamlofnakbnbfjkohkbdigoodcejf))
is provided only for the convenience of developers and Google provides no
guarantees or warranties for this tool.

CSP Evaluator comes with a built-in list of common CSP whitelist bypasses which
reduce the security of a policy. This list only contains popular bypasses and is
by no means complete.

The CSP Evaluator library + frontend is deployed here:

### Example usage

```javascript
	const csp = require("@doyensec/csp-evaluator")

    var rawCsp = "script-src data: https://www.google.com;";
    var parser = new csp.CspParser(rawCsp);
    var evaluator = new csp.CspEvaluator(parser.csp, csp.Version.CSP3);
    var findings = evaluator.evaluate();
    console.log(findings);
```
